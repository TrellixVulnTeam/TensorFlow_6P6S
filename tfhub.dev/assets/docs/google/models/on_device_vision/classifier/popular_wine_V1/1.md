## Overview

This model is trained to recognize more than 400,000 popular wine bottles from
images. The model is mobile-friendly and can run on-device.

### Input

This model takes input of images.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 224 x 224,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `prediction:logits`.

*   `prediction:logits`: A vector of 409776 similarity scores, corresponding to
    items in the
    [labelmap](https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/labelmaps/popular_wine_V1_labelmap.csv).
    Note that each item may appear in the labelmap multiple times; there are
    373034 unique labels. Because the output vectors contains duplicate labels,
    **users of this model should postprocess its output**. Remove duplicates by
    keeping the highest-scoring logit for each unique label.

## Example use

```python

# TF1 version
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.Module('https://tfhub.dev/google/on_device_vision/classifier/popular_wine_V1/1')
...

# TF2 version
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.KerasLayer('https://tfhub.dev/google/on_device_vision/classifier/popular_wine_V1/1')
...
```

## Suitable Use, Limitations, and Fair Use Terms

### Suitable use cases

This model is **suitable** for:

*   Recognizing popular wine bottles.

### Unsuitable use cases

This model is **unsuitable** for:

*   Providing allergen information about a product.
*   Providing alcohol content information, such as alcohol by volume (ABV)
    information about a product.

### Limitations

*   This model may not generalize to wine bottles which are less commonly found.
