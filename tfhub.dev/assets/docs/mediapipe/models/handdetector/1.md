## Overview

The hand detector model detects hands in images. The model makes use of the
[Single Shot Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) architecture with a
custom encoder.

The model is designed for front-facing cameras on mobile devices, where hands in
view tend to occupy a relatively large fraction of the canvas. The model may
struggle to identify far-away hands.
