Deep learning model for semantic image segmentation.

<!-- module-type: image-segmentation -->
<!-- dataset: Cityscapes -->

## Overview

DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation,
where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on)
to every pixel in the input image.

This model has been trained on the Cityscapes dataset.
