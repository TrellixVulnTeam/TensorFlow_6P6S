        "In this activity, you'll use Fairness Indicators to explore the Civil Comments dataset. Fairness Indicators is a suite of tools built on top of [TensorFlow Model Analysis](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/model_analysis/get_started) that enable regular evaluation of fairness metrics in product pipelines. This [Introductory Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHT-ImFXPQo) provides more details and context on the real-world scenario we are presenting here, one of primary motivations for creating Fairness Indicators.\n",

        "In this exercise, you'll work with the [Civil Comments dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification), approximately 2 million public comments made public by the [Civil Comments platform](https://medium.com/@aja_15265/saying-goodbye-to-civil-comments-41859d3a2b1d) in 2017 for ongoing research. This effort was sponsored by Jigsaw, who have hosted competitions on Kaggle to help classify toxic comments as well as minimize unintended model bias. \n",

For example, in a content moderation system, a higher-than-overall false positive rate for a certain group can lead to those voices being silenced. Thus, it is important to regularly evaluate these types of criteria as you develop and improve models, and utilize tools such as Fairness Indicators, TFDV, and WIT to help illuminate potential problems.
